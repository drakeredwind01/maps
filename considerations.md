freeways:
0–500 Feet (The Red Zone): Not recommended. Air pollution levels (ultrafine particles, CO, and NOx) are at their highest.

500–1,000 Feet (The Caution Zone): The minimum recommended buffer. Pollution levels drop by about 70% by the 500-foot mark.

1,000 Feet to 1 Mile (The Optimal Zone): Health risks significantly diminish, though wind patterns can still carry pollutants into this range.

Distance: For a dialysis and oxygen user, aim for at least 1,500 to 2,000 feet (nearly half a mile) if possible. The cumulative stress of kidney failure and respiratory issues makes the body much less resilient to the "Red Zone" pollutants.



air ports/flight paths:
Dialysis/Oxygen Specifics: Because these conditions involve the blood and lungs directly, the "Optimal Zone" for this individual should be outside of the 5-mile radius whenever possible from an air port and flight paths.



flood:
"Zone A" or "Zone AE" are the 100-year floodplains (high risk)(especially Mission Valley).

Sanitary Issues: Floodwaters in San Diego (particularly the South Bay/Tijuana River area) are often contaminated with sewage. This is an extreme infection risk for someone with a dialysis shunt or compromised health.
